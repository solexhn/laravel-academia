# Laravel Academia - Fix Documentation

## Issue Fixed
Root route (localhost:9800) not loading while other routes (like localhost:9800/register) were working.

## Root Cause
Database connection issues in Docker environment due to incorrect host configuration in .env file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration
Modified `.env` file to use correct Docker database settings:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db           # Changed from 127.0.0.1 to db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=solexhn_academia
DB_USERNAME=solexhn
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

### 2. News Model Implementation
Created and configured News model with proper attributes:
- Added SoftDeletes trait
- Configured fillable fields
- Added relationship with User model
- Set up proper table name and casts

### 3. Docker Configuration
- Verified Docker containers are running properly:
  - franken (Laravel app)
  - db (MySQL)
  - phpmyadmin

### 4. View Changes
- Fixed footer partial in `resources/views/partials/footer.blade.php`
- Ensured proper view structure:
  - Layout extends from `layouts.app`
  - Included required partials (navbar, sidebar, footer)
  - Verified view hierarchy:
    ```
    resources/views/
    ├── layouts/
    │   └── app.blade.php
    ├── partials/
    │   ├── navbar.blade.php
    │   ├── sidebar.blade.php
    │   ├── footer.blade.php
    │   └── head.blade.php
    └── home/
        └── index.blade.php
    ```

## How to Apply Changes
1. Ensure Docker containers are running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

2. Update .env file with correct database configuration
3. Clear configuration cache:
```bash
docker-compose exec franken php artisan config:clear
```

4. Run migrations if needed:
```bash
docker-compose exec franken php artisan migrate
```

## Additional Notes
- The root route works by fetching latest news items
- Empty news items result in empty collection (normal behavior)
- PhpMyAdmin accessible at localhost:9001
- Main application runs on localhost:9800
